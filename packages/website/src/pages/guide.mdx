## Basic Concepts

### Schemas and Fields

What is a schema? According to Zod's [documentation](https://zod.dev), schema refers to any data type.

> Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.

We have defined a schema before:

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#schema"

A schema can parse data from the outside world, and throws meaning error if the input does not satisfy it.

Our form is built based on the schema. Here, we have two properties, `username` and `password` to fill out. According to those properties, we should have two `<input>` elements, wrapped in a form:

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#basic-form"

Here, we have

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#basic-form-fields"

as our **fields** for property `username` and `password` respectively.

<Callout>
  A schema is any data type.   
  A field is a piece of UI to control a part of that schema. Plus, a form is the collection of fields to fill out a schema.
</Callout>

### Form and Field Controllers

To make our application better reacts with the user, we need to do better than plain HTML native forms.

`mobx-zod-form-react` provides a `useForm` hook which returns a `ReactForm` instance to manage the form and the fields.

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#use-form"

The `ReactForm` returned by `useForm` is a referential-stable [observable object](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html). Your components will re-render on its changes it you read its observable properties. We also see that `observer` is required to wrap our component, if we want the `Form` to react on `form`'s changes. Your form will not react if `observer` is not applied. Let's first bind the form to our HTML form and see the key properties and methods.

<Callout>
  Always remember to wrap your form with `observer` from `mobx-react` or it simply doesn't react!
</Callout>

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#bind-form"

First of all, we visit `form.root`. It is a `MobxZodObjectField` object that lies at the root of your schema, corresponding to the root schema you passed to `useForm`. `form.root.fields` is the record of fields, each value being a `MobxZodField` to manage a text field.

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#schema"

Although other libraries might enforce an object, but the root schema could be `Array`, `string`, `number` or anything else. We use TypeScript generic types to map them to corresponding `MobxZodField`.

Then, we call `form.bindField` for input objects against each property from `form.root.fields`.

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#bind-field-1"

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#bind-field-2"

This effectively applies a list of props to that `<input />` element: `value`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `ref`, `type`, `checked`. By doing that, we have everything we need to bind the input to our `ReactForm` and perform validation, state management and UI utilities.

While `bindField` does a lot of stuff under the hood, `bindForm` is easier to master. It provides a idiomatic `onSubmit` handler for the form, which stops the event from propagating, sets `action` to `#` so that the page won't refresh after you click the submit button, and calls the user `onSubmit` when the validation is passed and `onSubmitError` when the validation is failed.

@include "../components/examples/guide.tsx#bind-form-1"
