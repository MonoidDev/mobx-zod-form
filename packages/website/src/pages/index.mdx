# Introduction

## What is Mobx Zod Form?

Mobx Zod Form is a data-first form builder based on two amazing libraries: `mobx` and `zod`.

You first define your form in `zod`:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#define-form"

Define your field controller component:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#define-controller"

Connect your `form` to your field controllers:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#connect-form"


Then you just created an end-to-end safe form widget!

## How is Mobx Zod Form different from other libs?

### No magic-strings

Some libraries, like `formik` and `react-final-form`, force user to use the path to the field to connect the field with the input:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Formik, Field, Form } from 'formik';

const Basic = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Sign Up</h1>
    <Formik
      initialValues={{
        firstName: '',
        lastName: '',
        email: '',
      }}
      onSubmit={async (values) => {
        await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500));
        alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
      }}
    >
      <Form>
        <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name</label>
        <Field id="firstName" name="firstName" placeholder="Jane" />

        <label htmlFor="lastName">Last Name</label>
        <Field id="lastName" name="lastName" placeholder="Doe" />

        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <Field
          id="email"
          name="email"
          placeholder="jane@acme.com"
          type="email"
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
    </Formik>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(<Basic />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Although they entitle them as supporting TypeScript, the following code is not really type-safe:

```tsx
<Field id="firstName" name="firstName" placeholder="Jane" />
<Field id="lastName" name="lastName" placeholder="Doe" />
```

Not only does the user need to write `id="firstName"` and `name="firstName"` with the same `"firstName"` twice, but also the user does this with NO type-checks. For a form with a handful of fields, that might be just convenient enough, but our experience of maintaining a huge number of forms proves this not really feasible.

### Decode, not raw data.

Libraries like `formik` gives the parsing and validation part away to the user, which could be quite a burden as the form gets complex. 

```tsx
<Formik
  initialValues={{
    name: '',
    age: '',
  }}
  validate={(values) => {
    const errors = {};
    if (Number.isNaN(Number.parseInt(values.age))) {
      errors.age = 'Please input a valid age';
    }
    return errors;
  }}
  onSubmit={(values) => {
    const ageParsed = Number.parseInt(values.age);
    // ...
  }}
>
  // ...
</Formik>
```

Because the fact that `<input />` doesn't really give us a `number`, but gives us a `number` **encoded** in a decimal format string, we are passed with `values.age` as a `string` everywhere. We need to handle it both in `validate` and `onSubmit`, which brings trouble.

In Mobx Zod Form, we first **decode** the form, casting any number-like `string` to `number` against our schema, then you have the digested value from `field.decodeResult.data`, as illustrated below:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#form-decode"

<Callout emoji="⚠️">Notice that in a cruel world, the decoding might fail. So `decodeResult` is actually a discriminated union with `success: true` only when the input is valid.</Callout>

### Compose, out of the box.

Consider you have a credit card info input, which you might use it a couple of times in the UI:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#form-compose-schema"

Now you can plug `CreditCardSchema` else where, and then bind the corresponding field to `CreditCardInput`:

@include "../components/examples/index.tsx#form-compose-form"

The entire process is, of course, as type-checked as guaranteed.

Consider that you are using `formik`, you might need to write the following component:

```tsx
const CreditCardInput = ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Field id={`${name}.cardNumber`} id={`${name}.cardNumber`} placeholder="0000123456781234" />
      <Field id={`${name}.secureCode`} id={`${name}.secureCode`} placeholder="123" />
      <Field id={`${name}.expirationMonth`} id={`${name}.expirationMonth`} placeholder="123" />
      <Field id={`${name}.expirationYear`} id={`${name}.expirationYear`} placeholder="2024" />
    </>
  );
};
```

Not only does this needs a lot of template strings, but also it just doesn't handle the repeated validation logic! I will leave how to do that in `formik` or `react-final-form` as your homework :)

## Takeaways

Our library powers the user in 3 ways:

1. No magic-strings. Declare your schema first, then bind your fields to your components in a type-safe fashion.
2. Handles decoding for you, not throwing DOM stirngs into your face.
3. Highly composable UI and validation logic.

However, as you can see from our example code, it might require you to write extra code and extra types to achieve that level of type-safety. Or Mobx/Zod might just not fit your ecosystem. Use it at your own risk!
